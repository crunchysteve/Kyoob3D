# Kyoob3D
OpenSCAD coding a core XY 3D printer hardware that uses cheap hollow square extrusions for framing, instead of v-slot. It started as a design exercise where I wondered how to maximise layer strength and keep it equal across 3 dimensions.

This is the 3D model code for my project [here on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6731282) and is still very much a work in progress and isn't even properly parametric yet.
