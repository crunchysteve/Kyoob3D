# Kyoob3D
OpenSCAD coding a core XY 3D printer hardware that uses cheap hollow square extrusions for framing, instead of v-slot. It started as a design exercise where I wondered how to maximise layer strength and keep it equal across 3 dimensions. This is the reason for the chamfered corner brackets in the main frame. This chamfer represents the first print layer, keeping the layer distribition equal in all three axes.

This is the 3D model code for my project [here on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6731282) and is still very much a work in progress and isn't even properly parametric yet.

If this makes it to a working prototype, the electronics will probably be powered by [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin) initially, as that's a firmware I know and use.
